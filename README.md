# The Zxc programming language

A small compiler for the zxc language, which should be as handy as Zig but just free as C. \
However, right now in its early stages it's more like a very limited Rust (which it's written in).
Although it already has good compile error reports. Plus it already compiles some simple programs from `tidy/ui`.
